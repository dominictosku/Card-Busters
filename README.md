# Card-Busters
My attempt for a card game in C#
## Still in beta 
# Rule
There are two players which are competing against each other.
Each player has a set of 4 cards. One card can be choosen while the other 3 get randomly autogenerated.
Once the battle starts, there can only be one card active per player and can performs attacks and other actions.
The goal is to destroy all cards of the other player, while strategically preventing your own cards from getting annihilated.
If a card gets destroyed, you must switch to one of your cards that are still available.
# Cards
The is a total set of 6 Elements you can choose for your card.
## Hydro
Can apply wet effect to enemy, increase damage from other sources
## Pyro
Applies burning to the enemy and deals damage over time
## Anemo
Strikes with sharp wind and cuts the enemy, weakening attack and deals extra damage
## Light
Can blind the enemy, reducing hit chance
## Darkness
Weakens with dark force, reducing various stats like damage and defense
# Roles
Each card also has a special role with focus on specific tasks
## Attacker
Deals high damage but has reduced health
## Healer
Can recover health from allies, with the cost of reduced attack
## Tank
A wall with high defense to withstand even the strongest attacks.
Has low attack
